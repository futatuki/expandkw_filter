NAME
    expandkw.py - a filter driver to expand subversion like keyword for git

SYNOPSIS
    git config filter.expandkw.smudge 'python <script-path>/expandkw.py -s %f'
    git config filter.expandkw.clean 'python <script-path>/expandkw.py -c %f'

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Python script to expand/unexpand subversion like keyword act
    as smudge/clean git filter driver. Please see 'filter' section in
    'git help attributes' for detail how it works. This script requires
    Python (tested on 2.7/3.6/3.7).

OPTIONS

    -s, --smudge
        Act as 'smudge' filter driver. Expand keywords enclosed by a pair
        of '$' characters. This is default behavior.

    -c, --clean
        Act as 'clean' filter driver. Unexpand keywords enclosed by a pair 
        of '$' characters.

    -e, --encoding
        Specify target file encoding to help to parse file.

    -h, --help
        show option summary (and exit).

KEYWORD EXPANSION
    Keyword expantion allows to embed commit information of the file.
    All occurence of keywords enclosed by two '$' character like
    '$Date$' are expanded to keywords with commit information, e.g. 
    '$Date: 2018-08-18 18:36:56 +0900 (Sun, 18 Aug 2018) $'.  Fixed-length
    keyword syntax like '$keyword::        $' is also available.

    This filter driver provides following pre-defined keywords:

        Date, LastChangeDate
            Author date in local time zone, in the form 
            $Date: 2018-08-18 18:36:56 +0900 (Sun, 18 Aug 2018) $'.

        Revision, LastChangeRevision, Rev
            Abbreviated commit hash, e.g. $Revision: 6e6c9e1 $

        Author, LastChangedBy
            Author E-Mail address encosed by <>,
            e.g. $Author: <futatuki@yf.bsdclub.org> $

        HeadURL, URL
            Full path to the file in working tree, as file:// URL.
            e.g. $URL: file:///path/to/the/file $

        Id
            A compressd combination of file path, abbreviated commit hash,
            author date in UTC, author E-Mail address, in the form
            $Id: file 6e6c9e1 2018-08-10 09:36:56Z <futatuki@yf.bsdclub.org> $

        Header
            Similar to the `Id' keyword but uses file URL of the file instead
            of file name base. e.g.  $Header: file:///path/to/file 6e6c9e1
            2018-08-10 09:36:56Z <futatuki@yf.bsdclub.org> $ (without folding)

CUSTOM KEYWORD
    Instead to use pre-defined keywords, you can define custom keywords
    by using optional module file kw_conf.py, by defining a dict
    kw_conf.default_kw, its keys are keyword names and its values are
    corresponding expansion format string. Note if you use kw_conf.default_kw
    with pre-defined keyword above, you must redifine them in the dictionary.
    Please see kw_conf.py.sample (or expandkw.py itself) for how pre-defined
    keywords defined. 

    You can also define per file keywords by using dict kw_config.custom_kw,
    its keys are file path and its values are dict of keyword name to format
    string, just like kw_conf.default_kw.

    In the format strings following placeholders are available.

        %a      author E-Mail address enclosed by <>

        %b      The basename of the file path
                (file name without directory components) 

        %d      Short format of the date of the commit in UTC

        %D      Long format of the date of the commit in local time zone,
                in the form of 'Date' keyword expands.

        %P      The file's path, relative to the top of the repository

        %r      Abbreviated commit hash

        %R      Full path to the top of the repository, as file:// URL.

        %u      Full path to the file in working tree, as file:// URL.

        %_      A space character. (currently as the format string is
                defined as Python string literal in dict object, it allows
                to contain space characters, though)

        %%      A percent character ('%')

        %H      Equivalent to '%P%_%r%_%d%_%a'.

        %I      Equivalent to '%b%_%r%_%d%_%a'.

BUGS
    File path (URL) expansion cannot be unexpanded if its components contains
    new line character or dollar sign ('$') because they are expand without 
    escape or quote, thus we can't parse keyword expansion boundary.
    Author E-Mail address contains dollar sign also cannot be unexpanded.

    When checkout file other than current branch or from commit other than
    HEAD, expandkw.py cannot embed correct information. This is because 
    git calls filter.<driver>.smudge *before* update meta data about
    current working tree, and there is no interface to pass which commit
    to be checked out to smudge filter. To expand with correct information,
    do 'git checkout HEAD' (or 'git checkout <current commit>') again,
    after switching working tree.
